abstract: "SLAM research is embarking on a new path, where focus is directed towards improving
SLAM map quality and visual aesthetics. This new interest of improving
maps is due to their various applications in localization and beyond. These applications
can be found in many fields such as data science, navigation, search
and rescue, architecture, intelligent transportation systems, and AR/VR. In this
work, a framework will be introduced that automatically generates SLAM maps
and another that automatically removes deformations and errors in these maps
and generates an improved version."
