Since I joined the Vision and Robotics Lab at the American University of Beirut in the fall of 2019, during my second year as an undergraduate mechanical engineer, my research with Prof. Daniel Asmar and Ms. Rema Daher is focused on SLAM mapping â€“ mainly on improving and evaluating the current multiple mapping algorithms.

I have worked on a new evaluation metric to assess the performance of map alignment techniques as well as an ongoing work based on developing a model to create ground truth deformed maps through parametric modelling of the lidar and odometry of the robot, and a machine learning model that can generate deformed maps. This current work has several applications such as a direct conversion from floor plan to a robotic map, improving SLAM output by autocorrection, and mostly, an output deformation model to assess map alignment techniques which is a continuation of my previous work.

Also, during my undergraduate career at AUB, I fell in love with the field of control systems thanks to Prof. Naseem Daher as well as Prof. Elie Shammas. Thus, I have deepened my research knowledge in this field by taking courses such as Adaptive Control and Systems Analysis as well as System Identification. Currently, my research in this field is primarily concerned with Adaptive Control, Robust Control as well as Adaptive Robust Control.
